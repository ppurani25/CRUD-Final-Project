About the Author: This website was created as a school CRUD project in a computer science class. I am still learning website creation and the languages used, but I do have some past experience with them. I have created simple websites and webpages in the past using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, but no projects quite to this scale. Extensive research was necessary for this project which allowed me to learn a lot from this experience. I look forward to continuing to learn website creation and expanding my current knowledge of these languages through many more projects to come.

Purpose and Reason for Creation: As stated above, the purpose of this website was to distribute and share email addresses of all students and staff in a university. This tool would be very practical to use for a large class to enter all their contact info to make communication easily accessible between the professor and students. This website also provides options to delete or update their info, making the project handy, easy to use, and relatively user friendly.

Creation of this Website: This website was made using Cloud9 in the languages PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Research and various code segments were taken from YouTube to create the final product. A variety of resources were used to satisfy the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) requirements. A MySQL database was created to support the website and to hold and store the information inputted. All the parts including files and code from HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript were then integrated with the MySQL database to form the functioning website. 

How to Use: Using this website is very simple. One just has to enter in their name and email into the designated boxes. Then, click the enter button to submit it. The data entry will appear above. Then, to edit, click the edit button and you will be able to change your information. If you want to delete an entry, click the delete button to erase it from the database. Most of the website is very intuitive and can be easily used by anyone.
